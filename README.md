About
-----

RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection) is a stand-alone software implementation of the μ statistic for selective sweep detection. Unlike existing implementations, including our previously released tools (SweeD and OmegaPlus), RAiSD scans whole-genome SNP data based on a composite evaluation scheme that captures multiple sweep signatures at once. 

Download and Compile
--------------------

The following commands can be used to download and compile the source code. 

    $ mkdir RAiSD
    $ cd RAiSD
    $ wget https://github.com/alachins/raisd/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip
    $ cd raisd-master
    $ make
    
The executable is placed in the path RAiSD/raisd-master/bin/release. A link to the executable is placed in the installation folder, i.e., raisd-master.

Test Run
--------

To verify that RAiSD is installed correctly, a test run can be done with the following commands. These commands are going to download a dataset (one of the many that we used for evaluation purposes) and execute RAiSD to process 1,000 simulated sets of SNPs (genomic region size = 100000 bp, weak bottleneck, selective sweep at the center of the region).
    
    $ wget 139.91.162.50/raisd_data/d1.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvzf d1.tar.gz
    $ ./RAiSD -n test_run -I d1/msselection1.out -L 100000
    
Upon completion, two output file are generated: RAiSD_Info.test_run and RAiSD_Report.test_run. 
    
In-tool Help
------------

RAiSD outputs a quick-reference help message that provides a short description for each of the supported command-line flags with the following command. 

    $ RAiSD -h
    
The quick-reference help message generated by the current RAiSD release is the following.

    This is RAiSD version 1.0, released in June 2017.

     -n	Provides a unique run ID that is used to name the output files, i.e., the info file and the report(s).
     -I	Provides the path to the input file, which can be either in ms or in vcf format.
     -L	Provides the size of the region in basepairs for ms files. If known, it can be used for vcf as well, leading to faster processing.
     -h	Prints this help message.
     -f	Overwrites existing run files under the same run ID.
     -s	Generates a separate report file per set.
     -t	Removes the set separator symbol from the report(s).
     -p	Generates the output file RAiSD_Samples.STRING, where STRING is the run ID, comprising a list of samples in the input file (supported only with VCF).
     -S	Provides the path to the list of samples to be processed (supported only with VCF).
     -T	Provides the selection target (in basepairs) and calculates the average distance (over all datasets in the input file) between the selection target and the reported locations.
     -d	Provides a maximum distance (in base pairs, from the selection target) to calculate success rate in terms of reported locations in the proximity of the target of selection (provided via -T).
     -k	Provides the false positive rate (e.g., 0.05) to report the corresponding reported score after sorting the reported locations for all the datasets in the input file.
     -l	Provides the threshold score, reported by a previous run using a false positive rate (e.g., 0.05, via -k) to report the true positive rate.

    
Input File Formats
----------------------

The current RAiSD release can process SNP data in Hudson's ms or VCF (Variant Call Format) file formats. The d1 test dataset, previously used for the test run, is in Hudson's ms format. For the VCF format, refer to the respective Wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format).

Output Files
------------

RAiSD generates two output files, the RAiSD_Info and the RAiSD_Report, with the run name (provided via "-n") as file extension. 

RAiSD_Info.test_run

The RAiSD_Info file provides execution- and dataset-related information (command line, number of samples, region size, dataset format), as well as a result line per SNP set in the input file. Each per-set result line provides the following information:
a) set index, b) number of sites, c) number of SNPs, d) region size, e) best-score location and the respective score for each of the factors that form the μ statistic, denoted as VAR, SFS, and LD, and f) best-score location and the respective score for the μ statistic (MuStat).

The RAiSD_Info file additionally reports total execution time, memory footprint, and statistics about the total number of SNP sets in the input file (total, processed, skipped), as shown in the last 6 lines of the file.

    Sets (total):     1000
    Sets (processed): 1000
    Sets (skipped):   0

For each set of SNPs (separated by a line that contains the separator symbol "//" followed by the set index), the RAiSD_Report file contains a set of result lines, one per evaluated genomic location, with each result line providing the genomic location followed by the calculated statistic values for the factors VAR, SFS, and LD, and finally the μ statistic. 
    
 

Required Input Parameters
-------------------------

The in-tool help message generates a list of parameters, as shown above. Those in brackets are optional.
    
    The basic execution mode does NOT require any FREE input parameters. 
   
In addition to the run name ("-n", used to name the output files accordingly) and the path to the input file ("-I") containing SNP data, the region length ("-L") is required only when simulated data are processed, i.e., ms files. The region length, which is required for calculating the μ statistic is extracted from the input file prior to processing when VCF files are analyzed. 

The following command lines provide two examples of command lines for processing ms and VCF files.

Hudson's ms format

    $ ./RAiSD -n ms_run -I input_file.ms -L 1000000

VCF format

    $ ./RAiSD -n vcf_run -I input_file.vcf


Optional Input Parameters
------------------------

In addition to the required set of parameters, several optional ones can be used. The in-tool help message provides a short description for each one of them. 

The -f parameter allows to overwrite existing output files. The default operation mode is to prevent execution in order to avoid accidental overwritting of existing output files.

Parameters -s and -t affect the way output files are generated. The -s parameter splits reports in separate files, one per SNP set, whereas the -t parameter removes the SNP set separator symbols "//".

Processing only a subset of the samples in a VCF file is possible with the use of parameters -p and -S. The former generates a list of all samples in the input file, stored in an output file named RAiSD_Samples.run_name, while the latter allows the user to provide a similar to RAiSD_Samples input file containing only the list of samples to process.

The optional parameters -T, -d, -k, and -l are used for evaluation purposes and are discussed in detail below.

Evaluating Accuracy
-------------------
RAiSD provides a series of parameters that facilitate measuring performance when simulated datasets are analyzed. Given a simulated dataset, e.g., in ms format, that comprises several sets of SNPs, the -T parameter can be used in order to direct RAiSD to report accuracy, defined as the average distance between a known sweep location (provided via -T and the reported best-score locations). 

The following command line example for the previously conducted test run demonstrates the use of -T and the respective output. All provided datasets, like the d1 used in the test run, exhibit a selective sweep at the center of the genomic region they simulate. Therefore, RAiSD can be launched as follows:

    $ ./RAiSD -n test_run_accuracy -I d1/msselection1.out -L 100000 -T 50000
    
Note the additional output lines in the RAiSD_Info file, reporting accuracy. The values are in base pairs, averaged over the number of processed sets of SNPs.

    AVERAGE DISTANCE (Target 50000)
    mu-VAR	1022.500
    mu-SFS	26137.655
    mu-LD	18577.810
    MuStat	1253.685

Measuring Success Rate
-----------------------
The -d parameter can be used along with -T to direct RAiSD to report the success rate, defined as the percentage of sets with reported best-score location withing a distance (provided via -d, in base pairs) from the known target of selection (provided via -T, in base pairs). The respective command line for a distance threshold of 1% of the total region length, i.e., 1,000 bp, is shown below.

    $ ./RAiSD -n test_run_success_rate -I d1/msselection1.out -L 100000 -T 50000 -d 1000
    
Note the additional output lines in RAiSD_Info file, reporting success rate. The results show that 62.6% of the runs report locations within 1,000 bp from the known selection target (location 50,000).

    SUCCESS RATE (Distance 1000)
    mu-VAR	0.692
    mu-SFS	0.022
    mu-LD	0.019
    MuStat	0.626


Evaluating Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)
-------------------------------------------

The -k and -l parameters can be used to direct the tool to report sensitivity. This requires to conduct a run on neutral data first and sort all per-set best scores in order to define a threshold for a given False Positive Rate (FPR). RAiSD does this automatically when neutral data are processed, with the use of the -k parameter, providing an FPR. The following command line illustrates this for an FPR of 5%.

    $ ./RAiSD -n test_run_fpr -I d1/msneutral1.out -L 100000 -k 0.05
    
Note the additional lines that report the respective threshold for the chosen FPR value.

    SORTED DATA (FPR 0.050000)
    Size			1000
    Highest Score		0.000450000
    Lowest Score		0.000089600
    FPR Threshold		0.000221867
    Threshold Location	50
    
Thereafter, the FPR Threshold value can be given to RAiSD when selection data are processed (via the -l parameter) as shown below.

    $ ./RAiSD -n test_run_tpr -I d1/msselection1.out -L 100000 -l 0.000221867
    
This will report the respective TPR value as shown in the additional lines in RAiSD_Info file as shown below.

    SCORE COUNT (Threshold 0.000222)
    TPR	0.995000
    
These results demonstate a TPR of 99.5% when d1 is analyzed.
